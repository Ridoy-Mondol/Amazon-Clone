This is a simple clone of the Amazon website created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

## Description

The Simple Amazon Clone Website is a basic version of the Amazon website that showcases the layout and design of the original site. It provides a static representation of different components, such as the navigation bar, product cards, and footer. The purpose of this project is to practice front-end web development skills and gain a better understanding of building responsive and interactive websites.
